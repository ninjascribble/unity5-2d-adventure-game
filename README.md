### Chapter 1.3 - Optimize Draw Calls
The strategy given for packing sprites is outdated as of Unity 2017. This method may still
be supported by the Legacy Sprite Packer (enable via project settings), but the newer
method uses Sprite Atlases to provide packing instead.

**See:** https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.1/Documentation/Manual/SpriteAtlas.html
